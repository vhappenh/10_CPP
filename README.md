# CPP

This C++ course comprises several modules aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of the language's features and concepts compared to C, emphasising Object-Oriented Programming principles. 
The modules cover topics such as memory allocation, references, pointers to members, and the usage of the switch statement. 
Additionally, they delve into overloads, and orthodox canonical classes, followed by discussions on Inheritance and Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. 
Further modules explore Try/Catch and Exceptions handling, different casts, Templates, templated containers, iterators, algorithms, and general container usage in C++.
